## Flight Delay Dashboard 
This repository contains a Python-based interactive dashboard that visualizes flight delay statistics. The project uses Dash and Plotly to create dynamic visualizations that analyze various delay types, including carrier delays, weather delays, NAS delays, security delays, and late aircraft delays, by month and airline.
## Features
     1.Interactive dashboard built with Dash and Plotly.
     2.Visualizes delay statistics based on user-selected years.
     3.Separate plots for:
             - Average carrier delays.
             - Average weather delays.
             - NAS delays (National Airspace System).
             - Security delays.
             - Late aircraft delays.
    4.Easy-to-use input field for selecting the year.
    
## Technologies Used 
            - Python
            - Dash (JupyterDash)
            - Plotly
            - Pandas
            
## Usage Instructions 
1.Clone or download the repository.
2.Install the required libraries from the requirements.txt file.
          pip install -r requirements.txt
3.Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Flight_Delay_Dashboard.ipynb).
4.Run the notebook to start the interactive dashboard.

## Data Source

## Future Enhancements
  - Add more interactivity, such as filtering by airline or month.
  - Extend the analysis to include data for multiple years.
